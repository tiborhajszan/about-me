    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        I belong to a generation that grew up with Commodore and IBM XT/AT computers, when there was no internet (imagine that!), the operating system was DOS, high-level programming meant BASIC, and low-level programming required machine code (yep - I actually did some machine coding on my C-64). Yet, despite being a computer enthusiast, I spent my last 25 years in academia doing mostly medical research and some teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became known in the field of neuroscience for my pioneering research on the "synaptogenic hypothesis", which is a novel pathomechanism of major depressive disorder. This mechanism is targeted by some highly effective antidepressant medications currently under development in the pharmaceutical industry. Research gave me the privilege to work in distiguished neuroscience laboratories on both sides of the Atlantic and experience inspiring culture at excellent institutions, such as Yale University (New Haven, Connecticut), Rutgers University (Newark, New Jersey), and Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Budapest, Hungary).
      </p>
      <p>
        With all the hype and fanfare glorifying science and knowledge, it is hard to believe that academia remains in the middle ages, still tromping on talent and fiercely resisting progress and new discoveries. I experienced these maladies first hand and realized that in order to grow and achieve my dreams, I must try my luck in the technology sector, where progress and innovation actually happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        But science and computing are closely related species. As a scientist, I mostly collected data from various experiments, analyzed the data with statistical methods, and finally published my results in a few dozen scientific reports. These skills along with my project management experience can be readily utilized in web publishing and data science, my chosen areas of specialization within the IT sector. I truly believe that combining my backgrounds in science and computing helps fulfilling my long-cherished goal of directly helping the millions of people out there suffering from major depressive disorder.
